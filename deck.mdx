# Why use Azure?

- Has pre-built functionality
- Allows you to focus on the core value of your application
- Don't have to worry about underlying infrastructure

- What OS are we using?
- What database are we using?
- How many replicated servers do we need?
- How many regions do we deploy to?
- We need to build a facial recognition model for fish
- We need a voice synthesis engine
